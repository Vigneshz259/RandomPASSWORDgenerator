project of Random Password Generator.

Right now i have added Password generate
 button and password output field only.

**** in future planning to add Copy the 
generated code into clipboard. ***

**** Could be a good idea where keeping one input
option where user can give Random names or something which should be 
used prefix or suffix in his password.****

**** another could idea to keep underneath generated password 
showing it contains minimum 8charcters and have a Capital and small letters and 
have a numbers and speial charcters like that ****
